###Invoicing System

A fresh food supplier sells product items to customers in packs. 
The bigger the pack, the cheaper the cost per item.

The supplier currently sells the following products

Product            Packs          
----------------------------------

Watermelons        3 pack @ $6.99
                   5 pack @ $8.99
                   
Pineapples         2 pack @ $9.95
                   5 pack @ $16.95
                   8 pack @ $24.95
                   
Rockmelons         3 pack @ $5.95
                   5 pack @ $9.95
                   9 pack @ $16.99
                   

Your task is to build a system that can take a customer order...

###For example, something like:

10 Watermelons
14 Pineapples
13 Rockmelons

And generate an invoice for the order...

###For example, something like:

10 Watermelons         $17.98
   - 2 x 5 pack @ $8.99
14 Pineapples          $54.80
   - 1 x 8 pack @ $24.95
   - 3 x 2 pack @ $9.95
13 Rockmelons          $25.85
   - 2 x 5 pack @ $9.95
   - 1 x 3 pack @ $5.95
-----------------------------
TOTAL                  $98.63

Note that the system has determined the optimal packs to fill the order.
You can assume that bigger packs will always have a cheaper cost per unit price.

Advice:
- The exact method & format of input/output is not important
- Write code you will be happy to put into production
- We like tests at Fresho... hint hint ;)
- Make sure your code handles the given example.
- If something is not clear donâ€™t hesitate to ask, or just make an assumption and go with it
- Its just an exercise, so no need to go overboard or spend too long on it :)
